As this app is only a freetimeproject, windows tells you that this programm may be a threat.
Allow the start of the app if you want to use it.

# Menu - Items
In the menu on the left five categories are provided.

- Shopping List
- Items
- Categories
- Shops
- Meals

When opening the shopping list for the first time, you have to create the categories first.

## Categories
Categories are used to categorize all the items.
The advantage to use categories is that your shopping - lists will be generated in the order of the items in the shop, in which you will buy the items. This benefit is especially great for larger shopping lists.
While creating categories, the order is not relevant. You will set the order of the categories for each shop later.

Chose your categories wisely. The more categories you use, the harder it will be to categorize your items.
But less categories means less specific sorting of the shopping lists.
Don't worry: you can change your categorization afterwards if you want to.
It all depends on your needs.

Here is an example of categories to start with:

- baked goods
- vegetables
- fruits
- beverages
- seasonings
- hygiene
- canned goods
- refrigerated food
- frozen food
- milk products
- sweets

## Shops
The shops are created to be able to define multiple sortings for your categories. The following fields are used so you can identify
the shop easily:

- Shop Name
- Street
- House number
- Postal code

After the creation of a shop you can define the order of the categories in the shop through the 'ðŸ†Ž' - Button.
You can move the categories up and down by clicking and dragging the category to another position.

It's not important that the order of the categories perfectly matches the order in the shop but: The better
the definition of the category - order, the less you will need to look on your complete shopping list while you are in the shop because
you are unsure if you are missing something. It saves time to define the category - order correctly so you don't need to walk back because you
forgot an item, which was not at the expected position on your shopping list.
Remember: you may always change the order afterwards.
