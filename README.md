# Introduction
The goal of this repository is to create an desktop - application, which saves time creating shopping lists.

Here are some features of the grocery list:
- It let's the user create a shopping list out of defined meals or out of static items. Meals and their incredients must only be defined once. Afterwards you don't need to worry about forgetting some incredients.
- Definition of categories for each item
- Manage multiple shops inclusive the order of the categories in the specific shop
- Creation of the shopping list in the order of the shop, in which the items will be bought in

# Why is this an Desktop app?
I find it much easier to manage shopping lists on a large screen.

Shopping lists can be easily moved to the smartphone after they were generated by this app. My favourite app is google keep.
I use google Keep as it is useable in the browser and on the smartphone.
Additionally all the data is synchronized between the devices instantly.
