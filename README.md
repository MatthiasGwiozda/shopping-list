# questions
- Do I use react / vue --> decission: first I start without react or vue.
    - advantages of using the frameworks
        - I learn something about the framework.
        - no boilerplate html - pages
            - It's not that bad because there are not many pages in this webapp
            - HTML - Elements can be injectes automatically with plain js
        - Data Binding
    - disadvantages of using the frameworks
        - more overhead in the application.
- How is routing implemented? --> decission: since it is a small application we don't have to worry about boilerplate - code. A html - skeleton is lightweight and custom css can be used in specific html - pages.
    - plain HTML pages
        - advantages
            - routing mechanism of the browser is used
        - disadvantages
            - boilerplate html - pages must be created
    - inject html into a dynamic container. The html - content can be generated through a script dependent of the current route
        - advantage
            - no boilerplate - code
        - disadvantages
            - routing mechanism of the browser won't be used
