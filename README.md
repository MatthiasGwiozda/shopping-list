# Introduction
Shopping-list is an **Windows desktop application** which helps you to create shopping lists.
First some data must be provided so that `shopping-list` helps you later to save time.
The time saving is expecially great when you buy the items for the whole week.

# Feature examples
Here are some features of the shopping-list:
- It let's the user create a shopping list out of defined meals or out of static items. Meals and their incredients must only be defined once. Afterwards you don't need to worry about forgetting some incredients.
- Definition of categories for each item
- Manage multiple shops inclusive the order of the categories in the specific shop
- Creation of the shopping list in the order of the shop, in which the items will be bought in
