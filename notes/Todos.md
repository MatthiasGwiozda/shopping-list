# Todos
- Implement generation of the shopping - list
- test Programm without any data in the database.

# Optimization / nice to have
- strg + r should not reload the component. sqlite breaks the app :|
- use "equal" column - names. The following names are not "equalized":
    - item = name
    - categories = category
- add information (title) for editableList - columns, which are not self explanatory
    - meals
        - meal - component
    - goods
        - food
- create initial categories
- Create documentation!
- Implement search - form for EditableLists
- disable the pages, which should not be useable when certain elements are not added, yet
    - alternative: link the pages in the elements, which don't have the data, which it needs.
- set a fixed width for actions - column so that the buttons are not "jumping" when editing elements.
- create electron skeleton with current Components - architecture
- test, if installing this repository from scratch works fine.
- test, if starting the app with an empty database works fine
    - categories_shop_order (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- add keyboard shortcuts 
    - to add new element (strg + n)
    - to escape an edit - form in the editableList (esc)
- items
    - create possibility to show all the shops, which are assigned to the items in one view.
- Find queries, which make multiple statements and wrap them in a single transaction.
- allow side - dishes to have side - dishes themselves. This can be useful for dips, which includes one "base sauce" for all dips: https://lieblingsgeschmack.de/5-blitz-sossen-fuer-raclette-und-fondue/
- When deleting an category, which is used in an item, show in which items the category is used so the user doesn't need to search long.
