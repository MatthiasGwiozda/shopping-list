# Todos
- create shops with editableList
    - create element to change the order of the categories in the shops
        - add the possibility to create additional actions in an editableList.
            - optimize styling
            - TESTS:
                - editableList without additional actions
                - editableList with additional actions
                - edit - button
                - delete - button
                - the additional action button must be a toggle - button. When klicked multiple times the element will open / close



    - automatically add a newly created category to the goods_categories_shop_order - table?
    - add google - maps link from shop - adress

# Optimization / nice to have
- create Skript (plop?) to create new Component
- create electron skeleton with current Components - architecture
- test, if installing this repository from scratch works fine.
