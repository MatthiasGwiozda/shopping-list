# Todos
- create function in HtmlUtilities, which creates a Html - Element with given innerHtml.
    - use the function where it is currently rational.
- implement categories - view
    - create reuseable table - component, which can INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE elements
        - pass data from the database in the reusable element as parameter



# Optimization / nice to have
- create Skript (plop?) to create new Component
- create electron skeleton with current Components - architecture
- test, if installing this repository from scratch works fine.
